# Team Lounges
This Project is about a site which tells us about the history of Spanish League named LaLiga

<!-- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). -->

## About This Project

In this project we have used an api named Sports DB API. [Link](https://www.thesportsdb.com/api.php) ---click to go to the api site.
This is site serves you to gain knowledge about Spanish Club History, when it began its journey also the says is it for male or female.
In our site we have tried to show around 50 clubs names with their history also their BADGES with corresponding BANNERS.

##Technologies Used for Building the site

### `React JS`

Full Project is Based on ReactJS. We have used many components to Build the site

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Bootstrap`

We have Used BootStrap to design our site also to make it responsive.

### `HTML & CSS`

HTML & CSS is a core part for building a site. I have also used HTML & CSS.
### `NETLIFY LIVE SITE LINK`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
